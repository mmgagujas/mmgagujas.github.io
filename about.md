# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹


I am a budding **software engineer**, fueled by a passion for problem-solving and a profound fascination with **computer graphics** and **mobile application development**.

My voyage through the realm of **Computer Science** is characterized by:

- My knack for deconstructing intricate problems into digestible tasks.
- My relentless pursuit of efficient, systematic solutions.

Feel free to connect with me!


My journey in the field of Computer Science has been driven by my ability to break down complex problems into manageable tasks and find efficient ways to solve them systematically. I have a strong foundation in computer graphics, with experience in creating accurate representations of three-dimensional objects and developing interactive graphics applications. My proficiency in this area is best demonstrated by my Open Graphics Library project, where I successfully transformed a 2D image into a realistic 3D scene using textures, the Phong Lighting Model, and a deep understanding of the graphics pipeline.  

I also have experience in mobile application development. My Android Studio Event Tracking App showcases my skills in Android development and my ability to create user-friendly mobile applications. The app, which allows users to track events, set reminders, and share event details, was developed using Java and XML for the front-end and SQLite for the back-end database.
